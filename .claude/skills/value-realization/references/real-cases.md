## Failure Cases

### Google Wave

**Product Background**: Unified communication platform launched in May 2009 (announced), September 2009 (beta), shut down in August 2010 (announced), April 2012 (complete). Lifespan: 14 months from beta to shutdown announcement.

**Quantitative Data**:
- 2009 May: Announced at Google I/O
- 2009 Sep: Invite-only beta (100,000 invites)
- 2010 Aug: Shutdown announced (14 months after beta)
- 2010 Dec: New user signups stopped
- 2012 Apr: Service completely shut down

**Value Proposition Analysis**:
- Stated value: "Unified communication" (abstract technical concept)
- End user understanding: Unclear - couldn't articulate what they'd achieve
- Product combined: Email, chat, wiki without clear use case
- End user question: "What do I get now?"

**Failure Analysis**:
- **Value clarity**: Low - end users couldn't explain why to use it
- **Perceivability**: Abstract - no tangible outcome to point to
- **Discovery**: Failed - end users couldn't discover value through exploration
- **Timeline**: Unclear - end users didn't know when value would materialize
- **Learning cost**: High - new interaction model required learning
- **Alternatives**: Sufficient - Email and IM already met needs
- **Network effects**: Missing - needed team adoption, but unclear value made it hard to convince others
- **Feature innovation ≠ value clarity**: Even with innovative features, if end users don't know what they'll achieve, they won't adopt
- **Technical concepts ≠ user value**: Technical concepts ("unified communication") are not values end users can understand
- **Network effect product value threshold**: Products requiring network effects need sufficiently clear value to convince others to join

**End User Feedback** (from post-mortems):
- "Got invite, opened it, didn't understand, never returned"
- "Cool features, but unclear purpose"
- "Friends don't use it, so can't use it"

**This case applies to**:
- ✅ Analyzing value communication failure cases
- ✅ Understanding technical innovation vs user value distinction
- ✅ Examining network effect product challenges

**Data Sources**: Google announcements, TechCrunch post-mortems, user surveys

### Quibi

**Product Background**: Short-form mobile video streaming service launched in April 2020, shut down in December 2020. Lifespan: 6 months. Funding: $1.75 billion.

**Quantitative Data**:
- 2020 Apr: Launch with $1.75B funding
- 2020 Apr: 1,700,000 downloads (first week)
- 2020 May: 72,000 paid subscribers (after free trial)
- Conversion rate: ~4% (industry standard: 25%+)
- 2020 Oct: Shutdown announced (6 months)
- 2020 Dec: Service shut down

**Value Proposition Analysis**:
- Stated value: "10-minute videos for mobile" during commute
- End user perception: Not differentiated from YouTube/TikTok
- Pricing: $4.99-7.99/month vs free alternatives
- Context: COVID-19 eliminated commute scenario

**Failure Analysis**:
- **Value clarity**: Low - end users didn't recognize unique value
- **Perceivability**: Tangible (video content) but not differentiated
- **Discovery**: Failed - end users didn't discover additional value beyond free alternatives
- **Differentiation**: Insufficient - YouTube/TikTok already provided short videos for free
- **No social features**: Couldn't share content, missing social value
- **Timing**: Wrong - COVID-19 lockdowns eliminated commute scenario
- **Value clarity**: End users didn't understand why "10-minute videos" was a value
- **Scenario assumption error**: Product creator-defined usage scenario (commute) ≠ end user-recognized value
- **Funding cannot replace value**: $1.75B funding and professional content cannot replace clear value proposition
- **Alternative threshold**: When end users have free alternatives meeting their needs, paid products must have clear additional value
- **Social era content distribution**: Content that cannot be shared lacks distribution value in social media era

**End User Feedback**:
- "TikTok is free, why pay?"
- "Can't share clips with friends"
- "Content is okay, don't need another app"

**This case applies to**:
- ✅ Analyzing value differentiation failure cases

## Comparative Analysis

### Short-term vs Long-term Value

**Short-term value products**:
- Characteristics: Immediate, tangible results
- Examples: Dropbox (< 5 min), Zoom (< 30 sec), Stripe (< 1 min)
- Observed characteristics: Fast adoption, clear "aha moment"
- Valid for: Products where immediate utility is core value

**Long-term value products**:
- Characteristics: Value accumulates over time
- Examples: Duolingo (6-12 months), fitness apps (3-6 months)
- Observed characteristics: Deep commitment once adopted
- Valid for: Products where accumulated results are core value

**Important**: Both approaches are valid. Choice depends on product nature and end user context. Neither is superior.

### Optional Bridging Mechanisms

Some long-term products add short-term touchpoints:
- Immediate feedback (seconds): Confirm action worked
- Short-term milestones (days/weeks): Show progress
- Social validation (ongoing): Community support
- Identity formation (weeks/months): "You're a runner" from day one

**Note**: These are optional design choices, not requirements. Some long-term products succeed without any short-term mechanisms when end users are already committed to long-term goals.
