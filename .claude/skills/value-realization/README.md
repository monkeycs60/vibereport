## What It Does

Analyzes product ideas through four dimensions with status indicators (🔴🟡🟢):

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Value Clarity** | Can end users articulate what they'll achieve? |
| **Value Timeline** | When do end users see results? |
| **Value Perception** | Can end users see/feel their progress? |
| **Value Discovery** | How do end users come to understand the value? |

Each dimension receives a status assessment with analytical reasoning and sharp questions that challenge product necessity.

## When to Use

Triggers when you:

- Discuss product ideas with uncertainty
- Evaluate features or plan marketing strategies
- Analyze user adoption or retention problems
- Ask "is this idea good?", "will users want this?", "why aren't users staying?"

## Real Case Studies

Includes quantitative analysis of real products:

**✅ Success**
- **Dropbox**: Clear value proposition — file access from any device
- **Instagram**: Identity transformation from photo sharing to photographer status
- **Duolingo**: 500M+ users — long-term value with optional short-term touchpoints
- **WeChat**: 1.3B users — "use and go" philosophy building trust
- **GitHub**: 100M+ developers — code backup and collaboration
- **Notion**: 30M+ users — flexible knowledge management
- **Netflix**: 230M+ subscribers — entertainment with personalized recommendations
- **Slack**: 18M+ daily active users — team communication and searchable history
- **MyFitnessPal**: 200M+ users — calorie tracking for weight loss

**❌ Failure**
- **Google Wave**: Shut down 14 months after launch — abstract value proposition
- **Quibi**: $1.75B funding, shut down in 6 months — unclear differentiation

All cases include data sources and quantitative metrics.

## Philosophy

End users adopt products when they can articulate what value they'll achieve.

**Key distinction:**
- **User**: The person using this skill (product creator, PM, designer, entrepreneur)
- **End user**: The person who will use the product being discussed

**Observed patterns:**
- When end users can articulate clear value → higher adoption rates
- When end users cannot articulate value → adoption challenges
- Some end users adopt without full clarity, then discover value through use

**Value types:** Identity and belonging, financial gain, short/long-term benefits, status and recognition, capability enhancement, time savings, problem resolution.
